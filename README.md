# Documentation for Unofficial FL Modding

This github repository sole purpose is to provide documentation on unofficial modding in flashing lights. The current documentation can be found at https://fl.sillymonkey982.com 

The documentation will continue to be updated, however it is planned to include steps on how to mod the game unofficially (legally), and provide file names and locations of certain textures, meshes and sounds.

### Documentation on text formatting and the software used.

This documentationn is hosted on Read the docs through it's community licensing. All credit to them.

If you are unfamiliar with read the docs and the sphinx software, you'll most likely want to know how to edit and use the text formatting options. Below, I've included a few links which should help you with this.
